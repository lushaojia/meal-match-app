# Meal Match App
Meal Match is a platform that connects users with surplus food donated by restaurants, grocery stores, and other establishments. The app provides a user-friendly interface for creating an account, signing in, and browsing nearby food listings. Users can enter their location manually or use the integrated Google Maps interface to discover available listings. Once a listing is selected, they can view details and submit a request to claim the food.

The app‚Äôs backend leverages the [Meal-Match API](https://github.com/lushaojia/meal-match-api), which supports geospatial queries to find nearby food listings and updates listing availability as items are requested.

This project was developed collaboratively with three other students for COMS 4156 - Advanced Software Engineering at Columbia University.
