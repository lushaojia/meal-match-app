# Meal Match App
This app provides a platform for users to browse "food listings" posted by restaurants, grocery stores, and other establishments with surplus food. It provides a user-friendly interface that users can navigate to create an account, sign in, and browse nearby food listings. Users can either enter their location manually or navigate via an integrated Google Maps interface to find listings in their area. Once they locate a suitable listing, they can view details about the available food and submit a request to claim it.

This project was developed collaboratively with three other students for COMS 4156 - Advanced Software Engineering at Columbia University.
